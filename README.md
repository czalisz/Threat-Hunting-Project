# Threat-Hunting-Project
This real-world SOC Analysis project aims to showcase my ability to actively discover and pursue malicious activity within Splunk using Sysmon by rooting out common adversarial behavior along with providing examples of basic but useful network investigation queries.   
## Objective
- Learn event log analysis
- Build Splunk hunting queries
- Detect attacker tradecraft
- Map findings to MITRE ATT&CK
## Tools Used
- Splunk Enterprise
- Splunk Universal Forwarder
- Sysmon
- MITRE ATT&CK
- Windows 11 Pro VM
## Key Findings
